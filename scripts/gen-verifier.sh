# Canonical post-processing (matches what the committed libid-contracts
# verifiers were built with):
#   1. every `assembly {` becomes `assembly ("memory-safe") {` — required for

#   2. the optional contract rename above.
#
# Deliberately NOT done here: `forge fmt`. This repo carries no Foundry
# toolchain; the consumer runs `forge fmt` over the output under its own
# foundry.toml before comparing/committing (libid-contracts does exactly
# that). Raw bb output + the two rewrites above is the interchange format.
#
# The verifier derives from the vk ALONE, so this needs only bb (pinned via
# toolchain.env) and artifacts/<circuit>/vk — no nargo, no recompile.
